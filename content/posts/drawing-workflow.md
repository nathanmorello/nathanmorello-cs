I love making little drawings. They help me think, reason about what I want to do, and give me that extra push to finish my projects.  
Since the AI wave exploded, I’ve started using it too — but _how should I use it_?

In this article, I want to show my workflow for creating illustrations for this blog — a process that _includes_ AI, though I wouldn’t say I _make illustrations with_ AI.

In a nutshell, I really like how Sebastian Wolter put it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7385952492616040448-c4TY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAATWyyYBbd1s061uIAxyTplgt7nytQ0JDfM):  
**“ChatGPT as a sparring partner, not an answer machine.”**

It took me a while to think through and outline this article — with some tests and experiments along the way.  
Meanwhile, I found my experience very well reflected in what Justin Oberman wrote in posts like [this one](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinoberman_how-to-get-better-at-ai-art-ugcPost-7379231965549539328-K2Dw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAATWyyYBbd1s061uIAxyTplgt7nytQ0JDfM), which explains the theory behind these ideas much better than I could.  
Here, you’ll find my own take — a _practical corollary_ to that theory.

## How It Started

For me, drawing has always been a natural, almost inevitable act.  
I inherited it from my father — a natural-born artist.

In our home, a “little drawing” was always something extra — small but essential — woven into our daily life. A birthday, a special evening, even a shopping list often came with one of his doodles.

That tradition continues today, like these two drawings he made for my kids:
