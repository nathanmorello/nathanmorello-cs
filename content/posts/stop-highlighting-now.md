The following is a thought I had reading [*How to Take Smart Notes*](https://www.amazon.de/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Technique/dp/3982438802?ie=UTF8&tag=googhydr08-21&hvadid=719378855680&hvpos=&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2470447675421112442&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_1igezu3og_e&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=172726841667&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=719378855680&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2470447675421112442&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061166&hvtargid=dsa-1595363597442&hydadcr=&mcid=&gad_source=1) by

If things like improving your learning method are your thing, you should read it.

## One of the worst study habits I ever picked up
One of the worst study habits I ever picked up—somewhere in high school and carried well into university—was highlighting. Or underlining. Or whatever you want to call the act of coloring over text in the hope that it will magically stick in your mind.  
Unsurprisingly, I eventually stopped.

Truth be told, nobody really _teaches_ you to do it. Teachers usually just say: “Underline only the most important parts—***after you’ve understood them***.” 
But that second part rarely happens.

The average student skips the understanding step and dives straight into the ritual of highlighting, half-convinced (and often not really consciously) that this alone will help them remember things.

Over time, you even get really good at it—at decorating your textbooks with geometric patterns of color and whitespace. I distinctly remember, during my university years, being able to recognize topics _visually_ just by the shapes I had created with my highlighter. 
Nice trick… but not quite the goal.

And most importantly, **after just a few months, those bright marks inevitably fade into meaningless traces**—mute archaeological artifacts, irrelevant distractions that ruin, and sometimes even block, the reading of what was once a beautiful text.

Today's overwhelming digital efficiency makes things even worse. There are digital highlights in Kindle, PDFs, Word documents—neatly collected by tens of helpful software into tidy folders, only to end up, in the best cases, needing to be reprocessed (because you’ve forgotten the context), and in the worst—by far the most common—being ignored, lost, or rediscovered later with a sense of embarrassment because you remember absolutely nothing.


## The solution has always been the same: stop highlighting

The times I’ve truly fallen in love with studying have almost always been when I had a book in front of me that I ***couldn’t*** highlight. In the library. Or an old family encyclopedia.

It was then—while jotting down short notes, thoughts as much as facts, in a notebook beside me—that I could _physically feel_ information entering my mind. And—call me crazy—my soul.

I still vividly remember the first time: I must have been 15 or something, hunched for hours over the volumes of our old encyclopedia, jumping from one entry to another to learn (I can’t even recall why) about the Battle of Qadesh between Egypt and the Hittite Empire, 1274 BC…

But finding subjects and moments that truly move you isn’t easy.  
What _is_ easy is making every moment of study interesting—by taking notes instead of highlighting.

**Don’t highlight.**  
**Don’t underline.**  
**Learn to take notes.**  
**Think with them.**

Every single study session will become a moment of growth.
