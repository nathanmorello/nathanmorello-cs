## Trust me, I am a...
>*People often say that I’m curious about too many things at once.  
>But can you really forbid a man from harbouring a desire to know and embrace everything that surrounds him?*  
>**Alexander von Humbold** (1769 - 1859)

My name is Nathan Morello and the one that I present here is by all means a *curious stack*.
You will find all the articles of this blog (in chronological order) at "All Articles" on the menu here above.  

There are some articles that are at the core of it: **my journey in the world of DevOps** enginering and **IT notes** and walkthorugs of things that I have learned along the way in my experience as sysadmin. The articles that pertain this area fall under the category "Tech Stack," here on the menu above.  

I was not always in this field, though. For many years I worked in [academia](https://independent.academia.edu/NathanMorello) as historian and philologist. My field was the history and languages of Anicent Near East, especially Mesopotamian [empires](https://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/riao/RulersofAssyria/index.html), frontiers and [spies](https://www.amazon.de/Spionaggio-biblico-nellimpero-Alessia-Fassone/dp/8888693270/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1LOO96I6ZALND&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.aC2qorI4xI2Nc7LjSb7AZI1IKwpNssmuxblXloDeVgQvpBlitZV8aczMIim3sULo9BkwIy9LLnVkBw6OX18j00xSSU-0z8z825vZQcvTOarwy87oTXWDZW8GYvpCmn2LhCHQP9UDj0Atmlvv9vrDj6xMo1hTeCcGad0r1RjyRdLJ0f-ba1neYVD8fSWTwDjt5hrpw1HrVMu-YWDAfIHZyHA5YLfj8EhhLkyMkcbTaCI.L1V0QEzOCWdqZcoEQs5c2jM58Zs9FN7Qe8VbevoVDbk&dib_tag=se&keywords=nathan+morello&qid=1761775964&sprefix=nathan+morello%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-4). Before that, I educated in Romance and Semitic philology.
Philology is mainly about the role that languages play in the culture of the people that speak them.

Before that and during most of my university years, I have been a painter and a [musician](https://youtu.be/ltD9QT6vnuw?si=aldr1A453R-O19qH), and although these are not part of my everyday life anymore, all these different experiences very much *shape* the way I perceive the world and I learn about it. 

So, stories, cultures, languages, systems, codes, learning methods... These are just few of the subjects that I follow at the moment and they tend to come up together, when I think, talk and write. Articles in which this "lateral" material is more relevant fall under the category "Soft Stack," here on the menu above.
